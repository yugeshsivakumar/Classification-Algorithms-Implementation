# Classification-Algorithms-Implementation
# Overview
This project implements various Classification algorithms to provide a comprehensive understanding of Classification techniques.

The following algorithms are covered:

- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbour 
- Support vector machine 
- Kernel SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree 
- Random forest 



Each algorithm is implemented in separate Jupyter notebooks

To run the notebooks, you'll need the following Python packages:

# Requirements
To run the notebooks, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
